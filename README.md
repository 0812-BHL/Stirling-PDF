# StirlingPDF rewrite

This is the development repository for the new StirlingPDF backend. With the power of JS, WASM & GO this will provide almost all functionality SPDF can do currently directly on the client. For automation purposes this will still provide an API to automate your workflows.

## New/Planned Features

- Propper auth using passportjs
- Workflows & Node based editing of them.
- Client side PDF-Manipulation
- Stateful UI
